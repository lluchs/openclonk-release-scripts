Steps to use this:

	* Build c4group for the host machine and add it to $HOME/bin
	  or add a symlink there
	* Add the file keys/key-boom.txt with the key for authentication
	  with the masterserver
	* Add the file keys/key-ck.txt with the key for authentication with the
	  development snapshot page
	* Add the file keys/key-isilkor.txt with the key for authentication
	  with the push notification
	* Add the file passwd/nightly.txt with the FTP password for
	  the nightly builds
	* Add the file passwd/docs.txt with the FTP password for
	  the documentation upload
	* Download the autobuild dependencies from
	  http://hg.openclonk.org/openclonk/static/autobuild/
	  and extract them into dependencies/win32-x86-mingw
	  and dependencies/win32-x64-mingw, respectively.
	  (TODO: This step could be automatized)
	* Create a symlink of oc-release.cgi to a directory seen by your
	  Apache, and add this to the .htaccess:

		<Files *.cgi>
        		Options ExecCGI
	        	SetHandler cgi-script
		</Files>

	* Run main.py in a screen session in a loop so that it gets
	  restarted when it crashes.
