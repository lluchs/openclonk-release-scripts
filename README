Steps to use this:

	* Use Python 2.7 (I suggest using a virtualenv) and install the following packages with pip:

	  backports.lzma==0.0.3
	  defusedxml==0.4.1
	  docutils==0.12
	  ftptool==0.7.1
	  libxml2-python==2.6.21
	  paramiko==2.4.1
	  pika==0.10.0
	  six==1.10.0
	  SOAPpy==0.12.22
	  wheel==0.24.0
	  wstools==0.4.3

	* Build c4group for the host machine and add it to $HOME/bin
	  or add a symlink there
	* Add the file keys/key-boom.txt with the key for authentication
	  with the masterserver
	* Add the file keys/key-ck.txt with the key for authentication with the
	  development snapshot page
	* Add the file keys/key-isilkor.txt with the key for authentication
	  with the push notification
	* Add the file passwd/nightly.txt with the FTP password for
	  the nightly builds
	* Add the file passwd/docs.txt with the FTP password for
	  the documentation upload
	* Download the autobuild dependencies from


	  https://autobuild.openclonk.org/static/binaries/openclonk-deps-win32-amd64-mingw.zip
	  https://autobuild.openclonk.org/static/binaries/openclonk-deps-win32-i386-mingw.zip
	  https://autobuild.openclonk.org/static/binaries/mape-deps-win32-amd64-mingw.zip
	  https://autobuild.openclonk.org/static/binaries/mape-deps-win32-i386-mingw.zip

	  and extract them into dependencies/win32-x86-mingw
	  and dependencies/win32-x64-mingw, respectively.
	* Create a symlink of the web/ directory to a directory seen by your
	  Apache. Make sure python and python-pyinotify are installed on the
	  webserver.
	* Run main.py in a screen session in a loop, or write a simple crontab or
	  init script that starts/restarts it when it crashes.
