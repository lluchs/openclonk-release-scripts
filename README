Steps to use this:

	* Build c4group for the host machine and add it to $HOME/bin
	  or add a symlink there
	* Add the file keys/key-boom.txt with the key for authentication
	  with the masterserver
	* Add the file passwd/nightly.txt with the FTP password for
	  the nightly builds
	* Download the nightly dependencies from the nightly builds
	  webpage and extract them into dependencies/win32-x86-mingw
	  and dependencies/win32-x64-mingw, respectively.
	  (TODO: This step could be automatized)
	* Run main.py in a screen session in a loop so that it gets
	  restarted when it crashes.
